        "q1": "What is a birth chart?",
        "a1": "A birth chart (or natal chart) is a graphical representation of the positions of planets, signs and astrological houses at the exact moment of your birth. It reveals potentials, personal characteristics and life trends based on traditional astrology.",
        "q2": "Do I need to know the exact time of my birth?",
        "a2": "Yes, the exact time is fundamental for precise calculations, especially to determine the Ascendant and house positions. A difference of just 4 minutes can alter the Ascendant. If you don't know it, check your birth certificate or hospital records.",
        "q3": "How do you calculate the birth chart?",
        "a3": "We use Swiss Ephemeris with NASA's JPL DE431 ephemeris, ensuring astronomical precision greater than 0.001°. Our algorithms calculate planetary positions, astrological houses (multiple systems), aspects between planets and sensitive points like lunar nodes and Arabic parts.",
        "q4": "Is my data safe?",
        "a4": "Yes! We use end-to-end SSL/TLS encryption, secure storage and are 100% compliant with LGPD and GDPR. Your data is never shared with third parties. You have total control: you can access, correct or delete your data at any time.",
        "q5": "Can I create birth charts for other people?",
        "a5": "Yes! You can create as many birth charts as you want - for friends, family, clients (if you're a professional astrologer), historical figures, etc. There's no limit on charts created. Just enter the correct birth data.",
        "q6": "Is the service really free?",
        "a6": "Yes, completely free! You can create unlimited birth charts, view professional graphics, access AI interpretations and export PDFs without paying anything. No hidden fees, trial periods or limitations. It's free forever.",
        "q7": "Do AI interpretations replace a professional astrologer?",
        "a7": "No. AI-generated interpretations are an excellent starting point for studying your chart, but they don't replace the in-depth analysis of a qualified professional astrologer. Use our AI as a learning and self-knowledge tool, but consider consulting a specialist for complex analyses or specific questions.",
        "q8": "How does Dark Mode work?",
        "a8": "Dark Mode can be activated manually through the theme button in the interface, or configured to automatically follow your operating system preferences. Ideal for night use, it reduces eye strain and saves battery on devices with OLED screens."
