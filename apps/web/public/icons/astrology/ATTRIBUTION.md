## Technical Details

- Format: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- Style: Outline/Stroke-based for consistency
- ViewBox: 24x24 (standard icon size)
- Stroke: `currentColor` for easy theming
- Stroke Width: 2px

## Usage

These icons use `currentColor` for the stroke, which means they inherit the text color of their parent element. This makes them easy to theme:

```css
.icon-container {
  color: #3b82f6; /* Icons will be blue */
}
```

## Design Principles

1. **Minimalist**: Simple, clean lines for clarity at small sizes
2. **Consistent**: All icons follow the same stroke weight and style
3. **Scalable**: SVG format ensures crisp rendering at any size
4. **Themeable**: Uses `currentColor` for easy color customization
5. **Traditional**: Based on historical astrological glyphs

## Sources and References

The symbols are based on traditional astrological notation used in:
- Western astrology traditions
- Unicode Standard (U+2600-U+26FF Miscellaneous Symbols)
- Historical astronomical/astrological manuscripts
